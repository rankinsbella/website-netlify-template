I am an aspiring developer who is passionate about working
in the development industry. My goal for this site is
to showcase my skillset and background in programming.

### Table of Contents :

1. About Me

2. Skills  

3. Closing 

### Quick Start

```bash
# if you don't have ember-cli installed already
npm install -g ember-cli

ember new super-blog
cd super-blog

ember install empress-blog empress-blog-casper-template
```

It will ask you if you want to update the `index.html` file and you should say yes üëç

If you want to see the blog system running on your local machine just run `npm start` and you will
be able to navigate to  [http://localhost:4200](http://localhost:4200) to see the blog in action.

The main thing you'll want to read about next is probably: [editing files with empress-blog](/the-editor/).

Once you're done reading, you can simply delete the default **Ghost** user from your team to remove all of these introductory posts!
