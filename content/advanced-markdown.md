## About Me :
  I am a college student at Allegheny College in Meadville, Pa.
I wanted to go to college so I can improve my skills in coding
and programming. I have always loved technology and working
with technology and creating software is my life goal. Coding has
become a driving force within my life as I take computer science classes
and see how important data is within our lives.
Working in computer science classes has enlightened me to the
scope of work I want to be a part of. The process of learning
the basics of computer science brought me back to my childhood
days of playing with Legos and figuring out the best combination
of pieces to put together. Using the skills I acquired to create
my own game was incredibly rewarding and solidified my place
in the computer science department and field. It proved that I
could compete with programmers that have programmed their entire
lives. I know that with more experience, I can break the shackles
of company servitude to become my own company.

## Full bleed images

One neat trick which you can use in Markdown to distinguish between different types of images is to add a `#hash` value to the end of the source URL, and then target images containing the hash with special styling. For example:

![walking](https://casper.ghost.org/v1.0.0/images/walking.jpg#full)

which is styled with...

```
img[src$="#full"] {
    max-width: 100vw;
}
```

This creates full-bleed images in the Casper theme, which stretch beyond their usual boundaries right up to the edge of the window. Every theme handles these types of things slightly differently, but it's a great trick to play with if you want to have a variety of image sizes and styles.


## Reference lists

**The quick brown [fox][1], jumped over the lazy [dog][2].**

[1]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox "Wikipedia: Fox"
[2]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dog "Wikipedia: Dog"

Another way to insert links in markdown is using reference lists. You might want to use this style of linking to cite reference material in a Wikipedia-style. All of the links are listed at the end of the document, so you can maintain full separation between content and its source or reference.


## Full HTML

Perhaps the best part of Markdown is that you're never limited to just Markdown. You can write HTML directly in the Ghost editor and it will just work as HTML usually does. No limits! Here's a standard YouTube embed code as an example:

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Cniqsc9QfDo?rel=0&amp;showinfo=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
