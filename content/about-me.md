## About Me :
I am a college student at Allegheny College in Meadville, Pa.
I wanted to go to college so I can improve my skills in coding
and programming. I have always loved technology and working
with technology and creating software is my life goal. Coding has
become a driving force within my life as I take computer science classes
and see how important data is within our lives.
Working in computer science classes has enlightened me to the
scope of work I want to be a part of. The process of learning
the basics of computer science brought me back to my childhood
days of playing with Legos and figuring out the best combination
of pieces to put together. Using the skills I acquired to create
my own game was incredibly rewarding and solidified my place
in the computer science department and field. It proved that I
could compete with programmers that have programmed their entire
lives. I know that with more experience, I can break the shackles
of company servitude to become my own company.
